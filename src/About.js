                                <h3>The Best Coffee Maker In The Town</h3>
                                <p>Coffee, like tea, has caffeine which acts as a brain stimulant and leads to alertness making coffee breaks much awaited especially in jobs with high stress levels. The popular coffees on a menu are Espresso, Caf√© Latte, Macchiato, Choc Latte, etc. that may have added milk, or other ingredients like nutmeg. The taste ranges from bitter [as in an Espresso] to mild sweet [as brewed in some parts of India], served with a large helping of milk and sugar. Instant coffee needs no brewing. Cold coffee is also a popular milk based drink. In many recipes, especially desserts, such as Tiramisu and some Ice Creams, coffee is used as a popular flavouring agent.</p>
